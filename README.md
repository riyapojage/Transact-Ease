# Transact-Ease
A simple yet powerful Bank Management System built in C++, designed to handle basic banking operations through a console-based interface. This project demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts and file handling in C++, offering functionalities such as account creation, deposit/withdrawal, balance inquiry, and account management.

## Features

* Create new bank accounts
* Display all account holders
* Search for a specific account
* Deposit money to an account
* Withdraw money from an account
* Loop until the user chooses to exit

---

## Concepts Used

* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects)
* Vectors from STL
* Functions and user input handling
* Menu-driven console interaction
* Basic memory management with pointers
