Transact Ease is a simple console-based Bank Management System built using C++. It allows users to create and manage bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view account details through a user-friendly menu-driven interface. The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and basic data structures in C++.
